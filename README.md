## What is CAINE'S JAWBONE?
Cain's Jawbone is one of the world's toughest puzzle games. 

It dates back to 1934 and was written by Edward Powys Mather under the pseudoname Torquemada.

Cain's Jawbone is a murder mystery that is 100 pages long. The concept of the puzzle is that the mystery was typed up and then the pages were mixed up. The goal is to put the novel back in order and determine who all was murdered and who commited each one. 

Only a handful of people have solved the puzzle. Two people solved it after its initial run. The book was republished in 2019 and John Finnemore solved the puzzle over the course of six months during Covid lockdown.

## What is this project?
I am going to see what I can learn about the text using natural language processing and generally pick apart the text with code. 

## Do I think I will solve it?
No. 

## Where can I get a copy?
I suggest an independent bookstore! I like this [one](https://www.nowherebookshop.com/book/9781800180796).
